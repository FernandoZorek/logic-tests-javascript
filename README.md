# JavaScript Logic Tests

This repository contains a collection of logic tests that I developed to improve my JavaScript skills.

## Challenges

The tests are organized into folders by difficulty level:

* **Beginner:** Basic conditional logic and loop tests.
* **Intermediate:** More complex tests with functions and objects.
* **Advanced:** Challenging tests that require knowledge of algorithms and data structures.

## Running the Tests:

* Choose the folder that corresponds to your skill level or desired challenge.
* Open the .js file of your choice within the chosen folder.
* Copy the code from the file.
* Access your browser's console (usually Ctrl+Shift+J on Chrome or Cmd+Option+J on Safari).
* Paste the code into the console and press Enter.
* Observe the result and compare it with the expected answer, which can be found in the comments within the code.

## Objective

This repository aims to:

* Demonstrate my logic and JavaScript skills.
* Help other developers practice and improve their skills.
* Create a community to share knowledge and solutions.
